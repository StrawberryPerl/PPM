This is version 2.1.8 of the Perl Package Manager, PPM.

See the POD contained in bin/ppm.pl for information on how to use the
PPM client.

See the POD contained in lib/PPM.pm for information on how to use the
PPM library to write an alternative client.

Warning: This version of PPM may not be *entirely* usable, in its current
form, outside of ActiveState's ActivePerl distributions (i.e., the only
distributions I use PPM on).  Any patches (particularly documentation 
and setup) that make it a more generally useful tool will be gratefully 
accepted.
