Version 1.1, Oct 20, 1999

    o  `query' and `search' commands now include version and package
       abstract information.
    o  `query' and `search' output is displayed with a more pleasing layout.
    o  Commands may now be abbreviated to a unique identifier (e.g. `sea'
       instead of `search').
    o  The list of PPDs available from a repository is now being cached.
    o  `info' and `summary' commands are no longer available (since
       `query' and `search' now display the same information).
    o  A few other annoying bugs have been fixed (e.g. a header is no longer
       being displayed unless `search' actually returned some results).

Version 1.1.1 Oct 31, 1999

    o  Added ability to relocate a Unix module (RelocPerl.pm)
    o  ppm.pl gets installed as 'ppm' on Unix platforms

Version 1.1.2 Nov 14, 1999

    o  Fixed a bug where .packlist would get created as a directory when
       using UNC paths.

Version 1.1.3 Feb 01, 2000

    o  Options that aren't explicitly set during save now retain their
       default values (problem with VPM).
    o  Cleaned up '$root' code in InstallPackages();  code comparing
       ROOT to $Config{prefix} now ignores case.
    o  Cleaned up incorrect use of defined() on aggregates.

Version 1.1.4 March 01, 2000

    o Not finding a PPD during a verify is no longer an error condition.
    o ppm.xml <LOCATION> entries for default packages now points to the
      correct place (soap://...).
    o install.ppm makes above change to ppm.xml during PPM upgrade.
    o Check to make sure an implementation exists (not just a PPD) before
      removing an existing package prior to upgrade.
    o Workaround for a core bug with (?i) in an empty regex. This caused,
      for example, "ppm query" to return nothing.
    o Fix for getcwd() returning a bare drive letter when in the root
      directory of a drive.

Version 2.0 July 1, 2000

    o fixed bug where 'case' settings didn't work in command-line mode.

    o re-write of the way online help is created (thanks Jan Dubois).
    o normalize command-line and interactive option prefix to '--'.
    o got rid of ghastly "Yes/No" settings for certain options.
    o --searchtag option is gone: use --author or --abstract instead.
    o added documented but missing [--case|nocase] functionality with 
      query and search commands.
    o cleaned up code that did case-sensitivity handling for searches
    o substantial re-write of the ppm.pl front-end

    o new PPM SOAP server implementation in the server/ directory
    o SOAP code rewritten to use SOAP-Lite
    o turned off 'more' functionality unless in interactive mode
    o fixed ignored '--location' argument to 'search'
