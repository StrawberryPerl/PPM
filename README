This is an (unauthorized) development release of PPM, based on PPM-2.1.8
of Murray Nesbitt, with some changes made to make it work with perl-5.10.
For details of these changes, please see the Changes file. The original
Changes and README files of PPM-2.1.8 are included in this distribution
as, respectively, Changes.orig and README.orig.

Installation of this package will result in a set of default
repositories being included in the ppm.xml configuration file,
including the appropriate ActiveState repository. If you find 
searches are too slow with these repositories, try deleting
some.

In the future these changes will hopefully be integrated into a new
official PPM version.

Please contact Randy Kobes <r.kobes@uwinnipeg.ca> for problems related
to these changes and/or suggestions for enhancements.
